That is quite a bit. The good news, such that it is, is that it is the same 412 observations that are missing both. How much an issue is it? One way to examine this would be to estimate the model with those data and without. There are also 119 observations without family_size, of those 41 are missing. This means that 490 are missing via patterns in these three variables; that’s 0.1871658\n\nsoc_data %>% janitor::tabyl(languages, work_distance)\n\n languages    0   1 10 105 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19  2 20 21  3  4  5  6  7 8 9\n         1 1582 343  8   0  5  3  2  0  0  0  0  0 92  0  0 58 38 20 12 11 5 1\n         2    0   0  0   0  0  0  0  5  6  3  1  2  0  2  2  0  0  0  0  0 0 0\n         4    0   0  0   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0 0\n         5    0   0  0   1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0 0\n        NA    0   0  0   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0 0\n 91 93 94 96 NA_\n  0  0  0  0   0\n  0  0  0  0   0\n  1  0  0  0   0\n  0  1  1  1   0\n  0  0  0  0 412\n\nsoc_data %>% dplyr::filter(is.na(languages) & is.na(work_distance)) %>% skim(family_size)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nPiped data\n\n\nNumber of rows\n412\n\n\nNumber of columns\n9\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nfamily_size\n41\n0.9\n2.79\n1.54\n0\n2\n3\n3\n10\n▇▇▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(naniar)\nnaniar::gg_miss_var(soc_data)\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine if the data types are appropriate for analysis.\n\nTo be honest, I am not entirely sure what this means. Yes, we can analyse them in the current form.\n\nUsing a correlation matrix, pairplot or alternative method, identify whether collinearity is present in the data.\n\nregion is categorical with too many categories so it has to be dropped from plots. work_distance and languages are very highly correlated.\n\nsoc_data %>% dplyr::select(-region) %>% GGally::ggpairs()\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify and discuss anything else interesting that you see in the data.\n\nwork_distance is messy and highly correlated with languages.\nPrepare to build a linear regression model to explain the variation in annual_income_ppp using the other data in the data set.\n\nAre there any fields which you believe should not be included in the model? If so, why?\n\nI think there are principled reasons to ignore work_distance and languages as they have so much missing data. Not exactly sure why family_size would be relevant but that can be included and excluded.\n\nWould you consider imputing missing data for some or all fields where it is an issue? If so, what might be some simple ways to impute the missing data?\n\nI would not but largely because I am not sure what would necessarily predict work distance, languages, and family size. Were I to impute it, I prefer multiple imputation to represent the full data correlation structure in the imputation process.\n\nWhich variables are categorical? Convert these variables to dummy variables using a convenient function or using your own approach.\n\nThe fastDummies package is amazing for this.\n\nsummary(soc_data)\n\n annual_income_ppp average_wk_hrs  education_months    region         \n Min.   :  2863    Min.   :30.00   Min.   : 40.0    Length:2618       \n 1st Qu.: 62653    1st Qu.:39.00   1st Qu.:157.0    Class :character  \n Median : 82140    Median :43.00   Median :184.0    Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 76040    Mean   :44.19   Mean   :179.3                      \n 3rd Qu.: 90112    3rd Qu.:50.00   3rd Qu.:207.0                      \n Max.   :119564    Max.   :55.00   Max.   :280.0                      \n NA's   :10        NA's   :34      NA's   :19                         \n   job_type            gender           family_size    work_distance    \n Length:2618        Length:2618        Min.   : 0.00   Min.   :  0.000  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.: 2.00   1st Qu.:  0.000  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median : 3.00   Median :  0.000  \n                                       Mean   : 3.26   Mean   :  0.985  \n                                       3rd Qu.: 4.00   3rd Qu.:  1.000  \n                                       Max.   :10.00   Max.   :105.000  \n                                       NA's   :191     NA's   :412      \n   languages    \n Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:1.000  \n Median :1.000  \n Mean   :1.018  \n 3rd Qu.:1.000  \n Max.   :5.000  \n NA's   :412    \n\n\nregion, job_type, and gender need such treatment.\n\nlibrary(fastDummies)\nsoc_data.dum <- soc_data %>% fastDummies::dummy_columns(., select_columns = c(\"region\",\"job_type\",\"gender\"))\n\nRun and interpret the model.

Did anything in the results surprise you? If so, what might be possible explanations for this.\n\nOriginally, the negative sign on Males but, when thought of in the context of the interaction term for education_months, it does not take all that many months to make up that difference. That the education premium as so large for males is discouraging but not surprising.\n\nExplain why you would or would not be comfortable using a model like this in a predictive setting—for example to help employers determine the right pay for employees.\n\nI would not. The reason largely stems from the need for an actual job description which, at least to me, is a far more important predictor of the salary/pay band than simple skilled/unskilled and education."

Use these functions to try to do the same calculation in the previous question using a single unbroken piped command. Be sure to namespace where necessary.\n\n\nugtests %>% filter(Yr3 > 100) %>% pull(Yr1) %>% mean() %>% round()\n\n[1] 52\n\n\n\nCreate a scatter plot using the ugtests data with Final scores on the y-axis and Yr3 scores on the x axis.\n\n\n# plot(y=ugtests$Final, x=ugtests$Yr3, xlab=\"Yr3\", ylab=\"Final\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(ugtests) + aes(x=Yr3, y=Final) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate your own 5-level grading logic and use it to create a new finalgrade column in the ugtests data set with grades 1–5 of increasing attainment based on the Final score in ugtests. Generate a histogram of this finalgrade column.\n\n\nugtests$finalgrade <- as.numeric(cut(ugtests$Final, 5))\nhist(ugtests$finalgrade)\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing your new ugtests data with the extra column from the previous exercise, create a box plot of Yr3 scores grouped by finalgrade.\n\n\nboxplot(Yr3~finalgrade, data=ugtests)\n\n\n\n\n\nKnit all of your answers to these exercises into an R Markdown document. Create one version that displays your code and answers, and another that just displays the answers.\n\nI am going to cheat a bit. I did it in quarto and it is one option to code-fold; so that both versions contain code, one hidden and one not with the option for the user to determine what they wish to see.\nOne additional thing, base R graphics are kinda ugly. We can use R’s esquisse package to turn them to ggplots.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nugtests %>% \n  ggplot(.) + \n  aes(x=finalgrade) + \n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(x=\"Final Grade\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nugtests %>% \n  ggplot(.) + \n  aes(y=Yr3, x=as.character(finalgrade), color=as.character(finalgrade)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x=\"Final Grade\", y=\"Year 3\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  guides(color=\"none\")"

The evidence suggests that likelihood of recent donations depends on where an individual resides.\nFor a bit of detail, I will deploy janitor::tabyl\n\nlibrary(janitor)\ncharity_data %>% tabyl(reside, recent_donation) %>% adorn_percentages(\"row\")\n\n         reside         0         1\n       Overseas 0.8782609 0.1217391\n Rural Domestic 0.6616541 0.3383459\n Urban Domestic 0.7735849 0.2264151\n\n\n\nExtension: By using an appropriate hypothesis test, determine if the age of those who have recently donated is at least 10 years older than those who have not recently donated in the population.\n\nYes. This is fairly clear from the evidence in question 7. Though more formally, as an hypothesis test, we should use evidence only in one tail. It is worth noting that the first group [0] is smaller, so we really mean a difference less than -10 and the evidence suggests that this is true as it is very unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.\n\ncharity_data %>% t.test(age~recent_donation, data=., alt=\"l\", mu=-10)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  age by recent_donation\nt = -5.2268, df = 105.15, p-value = 0.0000004403\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is less than -10\n95 percent confidence interval:\n      -Inf -17.16282\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n       42.19188        62.68675 \n\n\n\nExtension: By using an appropriate hypothesis test, determine if the average donation amount is at least 10 dollars higher for those who recently donated versus those who did not.

That is quite a bit. The good news, such that it is, is that it is the same 412 observations that are missing both. How much an issue is it? One way to examine this would be to estimate the model with those data and without. There are also 119 observations without family_size, of those 41 are missing. This means that 490 are missing via patterns in these three variables; that’s 0.1871658\n\nsoc_data %>% janitor::tabyl(languages, work_distance)\n\n languages    0   1 10 105 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19  2 20 21  3  4  5  6  7 8 9\n         1 1582 343  8   0  5  3  2  0  0  0  0  0 92  0  0 58 38 20 12 11 5 1\n         2    0   0  0   0  0  0  0  5  6  3  1  2  0  2  2  0  0  0  0  0 0 0\n         4    0   0  0   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0 0\n         5    0   0  0   1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0 0\n        NA    0   0  0   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 0 0\n 91 93 94 96 NA_\n  0  0  0  0   0\n  0  0  0  0   0\n  1  0  0  0   0\n  0  1  1  1   0\n  0  0  0  0 412\n\nsoc_data %>% dplyr::filter(is.na(languages) & is.na(work_distance)) %>% skim(family_size)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nPiped data\n\n\nNumber of rows\n412\n\n\nNumber of columns\n9\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\nnumeric\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nfamily_size\n41\n0.9\n2.79\n1.54\n0\n2\n3\n3\n10\n▇▇▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(naniar)\nnaniar::gg_miss_var(soc_data)\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine if the data types are appropriate for analysis.\n\nTo be honest, I am not entirely sure what this means.

If so, why?\n\nI think there are principled reasons to ignore work_distance and languages as they have so much missing data. Not exactly sure why family_size would be relevant but that can be included and excluded.\n\nWould you consider imputing missing data for some or all fields where it is an issue? If so, what might be some simple ways to impute the missing data?\n\nI would not but largely because I am not sure what would necessarily predict work distance, languages, and family size. Were I to impute it, I prefer multiple imputation to represent the full data correlation structure in the imputation process.\n\nWhich variables are categorical?

Did anything in the results surprise you? If so, what might be possible explanations for this.\n\nOriginally, the negative sign on Males but, when thought of in the context of the interaction term for education_months, it does not take all that many months to make up that difference. That the education premium as so large for males is discouraging but not surprising.\n\nExplain why you would or would not be comfortable using a model like this in a predictive setting—for example to help employers determine the right pay for employees.\n\nI would not. The reason largely stems from the need for an actual job description which, at least to me, is a far more important predictor of the salary/pay band than simple skilled/unskilled and education."

Are there any input variables for which you may be concerned that the assumption is violated? What would you consider doing in this case?\n\nI refuse to do this for this purpose. The proportional odds assumption is necessary for a cumulative ordered response model. An alternative model, perhaps, but there is no such thing as a cumulative ordered regression model without it.\nThat said, there is actually a large literature, mostly in epidemiology involving Stephen R. Cole about something called data expansion as an approach to these problems. Here is what it would look like.\nmanagers$Not.Bottom <- (managers$performance_group!=\"Bottom\")\nmanagers$Top.Performers <- (managers$performance_group==\"Top\")\nmod.bin.NB <- glm(Not.Bottom~yrs_employed+manager_hire+test_score+group_size+high_hours_flag+transfers, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=managers)\nmod.bin.TP <- glm(Top.Performers~yrs_employed+manager_hire+test_score+group_size+high_hours_flag+transfers, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=managers)\nlibrary(stargazer)\nstargazer(mod.bin.NB,mod.bin.TP, type=\"html\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot.Bottom\n\n\nTop.Performers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyrs_employed\n\n\n-1.170***\n\n\n-1.226***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.235)\n\n\n(0.305)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmanager_hireY\n\n\n-1.679***\n\n\n-0.984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.512)\n\n\n(0.693)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntest_score\n\n\n0.004**\n\n\n0.004**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.001)\n\n\n(0.002)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup_size\n\n\n0.098**\n\n\n0.124***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.040)\n\n\n(0.046)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh_hours_flagY\n\n\n0.332\n\n\n0.888***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.226)\n\n\n(0.285)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransfers\n\n\n-0.225**\n\n\n-0.338**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.093)\n\n\n(0.142)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n4.875***\n\n\n0.900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.125)\n\n\n(1.428)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n571\n\n\n571\n\n\n\n\nLog Likelihood\n\n\n-280.889\n\n\n-180.851\n\n\n\n\nAkaike Inf.

Those hired to be managers are less likely to be low performers though it does not well differentiate between middle and top performers. Higher test scores are associated with better performance. Managers of larger groups get higher performers. Those working high hours are most likely to be top performers. Finally, transfers are associated with lower performance ratings of the managers that they are departing; voting with one’s feet is a thing. Number of customers, city of employment, full or part time, concern flags and in office/mobile work have no obvious impact."
