## Solutions to Chapter Exercises in HRMPA

The first half of the course is built around [The Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics: With Examples in R, Python, and Julia](https://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/index.html) by Keith McNulty [Global Director of Talent Sciences at McKinsey and Company] that covers models for discrete data types [binary, ordered, nominal choices, counts of events, and survival/duration analysis].  This website provides my solution sets for the chapter exercises in the text.
